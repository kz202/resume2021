<h2 style='text-align: left;'> &emsp;I am interested in developing as a Junior Python Developer and I think that I will
be great in this role. I speak English at the B1 level, communication and learning new
tools from technical documentation is not a problem for me. I have been using Linux
systems for years so I am well versed in handling the terminal and installing from
repositories.<br>

&emsp;During my studies at the Kielce University of Technology, I had contact with:
C, C ++ and bash, but Python3, due to the syntax of the library and objectivity, I wanted
to develop to perfection.<br>
&emsp;I am familiar with Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and I am currently learning the
Django framework. Already during my studies, I had contact with MySQL and
PostgreSQL databases. I use PyCharm and Visual Studio Code environments on a daily
basis.<br>
I am currently learning REST framework, Redis, Celery and other framework for Django.<br>
&emsp;I am eager to expand my knowledge of tests, GIT version control system Docker
and code optimization.
I am an inquisitive, optimistic and sincere person, having no problem with making
new friendships.<br>
&emsp;In my spare time, I practice Python at Codewars.com and deepen my knowledge
of SBC (Raspberry, Odroid, Odyssey)<br>
In order to gain new knowledge and skills, I can start working with you free of
charge during the trial period with the possibility of working immediately.<br>
&emsp;I will be very happy to meet you at the interview and answer all questions
regarding of my candidacy.</h2>
